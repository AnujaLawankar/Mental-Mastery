Current Notes,

Problem we are solving: Lessening the mental load on a user/family
MVP:

User Logs In/Out
Create a Family (component) 
Select a Member (component) 

each family member's info (build upon)
(when storing family PII bcrypt maybe)
bday
allergies:{

}
blood type:""
medications:{
    {
        doctor,
        where last filled,

    }
}

maybe grocery list(component)
create lists(2 types, personal and family)

maybe (find an api for receipes) (component) (on select member page)
-use search to populate 5 posiable reciepes (has peanut alg/ removes all receipts with said ingriedent)

maybe Calendar API - every ones schedule, something with quick editing and recurring events
